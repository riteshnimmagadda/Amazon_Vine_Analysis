## Summary
From the above example, I dont think there is any bias on the reivews and below are the points that support my analogy:

* The percentage of paid reviews to the total reviews is very less, which is less than 3%. Hence the bias in customer reviewing is negligible.
* The total volumes of the 5 star reviews both paid and unpaid are just 2.18%, so the chance of biased reviews are very less
